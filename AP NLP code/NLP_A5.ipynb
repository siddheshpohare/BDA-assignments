        "\n",
        "        The text is then compared against predefined emotion keywords. If any word in the text matches a keyword for a specific emotion, that emotion is identified.\n",

        "\n",
        "    Sentiment Analysis is based on the polarity score provided by TextBlob. A positive score indicates a positive sentiment, a negative score indicates a negative sentiment, and 0 indicates a neutral sentiment.\n",

        "\n",
        "        If a match is found, the corresponding emotion is returned. You can easily expand this by adding more keywords or using a more sophisticated emotion detection model.\n",
