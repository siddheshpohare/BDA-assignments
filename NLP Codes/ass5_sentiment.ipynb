    "‚ùì Q1. What is VADER and why is it used here?\n",
    "A:\n",
    "VADER is a rule-based sentiment analyzer optimized for social media text. It‚Äôs used here because it gives accurate sentiment classification using predefined word scores and text patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚ùì Q2. How does the code classify sentiment?\n",
    "A:\n",
    "Using the compound score from VADER:\n",
    "\n",
    "‚â• 0.05 ‚Üí Positive\n",
    "\n",
    "‚â§ -0.05 ‚Üí Negative\n",
    "\n",
    "Between -0.05 and 0.05 ‚Üí Neutral\n",
    "\n",
    "‚ùì Q3. How is emotion detected in this code?\n",
    "A:\n",
    "Emotion is detected using keyword matching. Words in the input are compared to emotion-specific lists, and matched categories are counted.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚ùì Q4. What are limitations of this emotion detection method?\n",
    "A:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cannot detect emotion contextually\n",
    "\n",
    "Doesn't handle sarcasm, negation, or polysemy\n",
    "\n",
    "Only matches surface-level words\n",
    "\n",
    "‚ùì Q5. What is the difference between emotion detection and sentiment analysis?\n",
    "A:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment analysis tells if the text is positive, negative, or neutral\n",
    "\n",
    "Emotion detection classifies the text into specific emotional categories (happy, sad, angry, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "‚ùì Q6. Can VADER be used for long paragraphs or formal texts?\n",
    "A:\n",
    "It's better suited for short, informal texts like tweets or reviews. For longer documents, deep learning models like BERT may perform better.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚ùì Q7. What improvements can be made to this emotion detection system?\n",
    "A:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use pretrained emotion models like NRC Emotion Lexicon or text2emotion\n",
    "\n",
    "Apply ML or DL-based emotion classifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "Add context-aware emotion scoring\n",
    "\n",
    "‚ùì Q8. Can a word belong to multiple emotion categories?\n",
    "A:\n",
    "In this code, no‚Äîit belongs to one category based on predefined mapping. In real NLP applications, a word‚Äôs emotion may depend on context.'''"
